### ThrottleStop configs for HP Probook 450 G7 (Intel i5-10210U)
Honestly just a personal config list that helped me get some use from this useless junk of a laptop. I am no expert in overclocking - there is DEFINITELY a better way to do all of this but I think it's a pretty amazing attempt nevertheless.
This repo contains two files:
 - ThrottleStopSchool.ini - an efficient config that makes games and other processing run a tad bit faster [the HP throttling is really extreme and basically hinders any performance when not using ThrottleStop]
 - ThrottleStop.ini - an absolute behemoth of a config that turns the cpu in to a beast but ⚠️ **WILL DESTROY YOUR BATTERY IN A YEAR** ⚠️ [when plugged into the wall, the laptop still uses the battery to power its turbo overclock]

 I do NOT promise you any performance gains from using any of these configs. DO NOT contact me for help, I don't and will NOT take any responsibilty for your screwups caused by misuse of any of these configs.
