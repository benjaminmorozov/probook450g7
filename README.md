### ThrottleStop configs for HP Probook 450 G7 (Intel i5-10210U)
This repo contains two files:
 - ThrottleStopSchool.ini - an efficient config that will make your games and other processing run a tad bit faster and a little more efficiently [the HP throttling is really extreme and basically hinders any performance when not using ThrottleStop]
 - ThrottleStop.ini - an absolute behemoth of a config that will turn the cpu in to a beast but ⚠️ **WILL DESTROY YOUR BATTERY IN A YEAR** ⚠️ [when plugged into the wall, the laptop still uses the battery to power its turbo overclock]
